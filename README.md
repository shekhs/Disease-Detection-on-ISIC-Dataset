# Disease-Detection-on-ISIC-Dataset
A multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in tensorflow to detect disease.

Building a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma out of 9 total disease in dataset. 

## Dataset

The [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xLfSQUGDl8ezNNbUkpuHOYvSpTyxVhCs/view?usp=sharing) consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.
####
The data set contains the following diseases.:

 - Actinic keratosis
 - Basal cell carcinoma
 - Dermatofibroma
 - Melanoma
 - Nevus
 - Pigmented benign keratosis
 - Seborrheic keratosis
 - Squamous cell carcinoma
 - Vascular lesion
